    "Based on expert knowledge, we selected molecules with diverse structures that contain only a single primary or secondary alcohol group.\n",
    "- Since the target reaction is alcohol oxidation, we constructed a dataset consisting of primary and secondary alcohols.\n",
    "- If a molecule contains more than one potentially reactive alcohol site, the reaction becomes more complex, and the interpretability of the steric descriptors is significantly diminished. Therefore, only molecules containing a single primary or secondary alcohol site were included in the dataset."

    "\n",
    "We conducted a thorough conformer search workflow that combines [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) and [xTB](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb), followed by a final geometry optimization at the M06-2X/def2-SVP level of theory in [Gaussian 16 Rev. C.01](https://gaussian.com/relnotes/):\n",
    "1. **RDKit-based Conformer Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We used [MORFEUS](https://github.com/digital-chemistry-laboratory/morfeus) conformer tools, which incorporate RDKit, to generate up to 200 conformers per molecule with the following parameters:\n",
    "        > ce = ConformerEnsemble.from_rdkit(smiles, n_confs=200, optimize='MMFF94', random_seed=42, rmsd_thres=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "        > ce.prune_rmsd(thres=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "After pruning conformers with an RMSD threshold of 1 Å, we selected up to 50 of the lowest-energy conformers per molecule in ascending order of energy (based on RDKit’s MMFF94 energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **xTB Optimizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The selected conformers were optimized in xTB using the following command:\n",
    "        > xtb {file_path} --ohess --chrg 0 --json\n",
    "\n",
    "    - All optimized structures were confirmed to be local minima by verifying the absence of imaginary frequencies.\n",
    "3. **Gaussian Calculations**\n",

    "        >  \\#p M062X/Def2SVP opt freq=noraman\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Among the xTB-optimized geometries, the lowest-energy conformer was chosen as the starting geometry for a full optimization at the M06-2X/def2-SVP level of theory using Gaussian 16 Rev. C.01.\n",
    "    - All optimized structures were confirmed to be local minima by verifying the absence of imaginary frequencies.\n",
    "    - All final log files were parsed via [cclib](https://github.com/cclib/cclib) to generate xyz files (geometries).\n",
    "    - The resulting xyz files were saved into the directory: `steric-descriptors-alcohol/data/input_data/gaussian_optimized_xyz`\n",
    "    - The sdf file corresponding to the xyz files was also saved: `steric-descriptors-alcohol/data/input_data/gaussian_optimized_mols.sdf`\n",
    "    - The CSV file containing the dataset (including thermodynamic and orbital data) is `steric-descriptors-alcohol/data/input_data/input_dataset_alcohol_oxidation.csv`. Each conformer was assigned a `confid`, which is a sequential number starting from 1, ordered according to increasing RDKit MMFF94 energy."

    "\n",
    "The following sections describe the generation of MORFEUS-based steric descriptors for our curated dataset using two Python modules: Module 1 and Module 2.   \n",

    "We also performed a radius scan for each atom specification pattern.\n",
    "This comprehensive generation of steric descriptors not only enables the identification of optimal descriptors for the reaction but also allows for a fair evaluation of how differences in the specified atoms used for steric descriptor calculation affect the performance of the yield prediction model.\n",
    "In all cases, we assigned either the OH moiety of the primary or secondary alcohol, the carbon atom bonded to that OH, or the hydrogen atom attached to that carbon as the `center_atom` or `attached_atom`.  \n",
    "For usage details, please refer to each respective module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script `morfeus_vbur_sterimol_alcohol.py` (Module 1) provides the function `process_rows_for_morfeus`, which calculates:\n",
    "- Percent buried volume (%Vbur), both including and excluding hydrogen atoms.\n",
    "- Sterimol parameters (B1, B5, L) in both “standard” and “buried” forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module appends the newly generated descriptor columns directly to the input CSV file. Therefore, we ran it four times consecutively, each time specifying different arguments for `center_atom` and `attached_atom`.\n"
